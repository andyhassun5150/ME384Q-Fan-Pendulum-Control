# ME384Q-Fan-Pendulum-Control
Project to control angle of pendulum with a fan by Andres Hassun and Kelly Hyun

This project was added to GitHub after its completion to provide easy visibility to others. Arduino control code, Matlab transfer function code, and Python video analysis code was written by Andres and MatLab simulation code was written by Kelly. CAD was created in SOLIDWORKS by Andres.

The project utilizes PID controls to set the angle of the a pendulum using only a fan. A simulation was created on Matlab to find PID constants and ensure stability, and the constants were tuned upon testing the system.

Angular displacement data was collected by analyzing a video using OpenCV with Python. This data was used in for analysis in the report.

Linearization, transfer function creation, and the block diagram can be found in the report and file and was developed by Andres.
