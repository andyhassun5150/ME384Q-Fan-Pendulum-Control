# ME384Q-Fan-Pendulum-Control
Project to control angle of pendulum with a fan by Andres Hassun and Kelly Hyun

This project was added to GitHub after its completion to provide easy visibility to others. Arduino code was written by Andres and MatLab code was written by Kelly.

The project utilizes PID controls to set the angle of the a pendulum using only a fan. A simulation was created on Matlab to find PID constants and ensure stability, and the constants were tuned upon testing the system.
